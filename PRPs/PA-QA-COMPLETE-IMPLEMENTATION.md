# Product Requirements: PA-QA Complete Implementation via Multi-Agent Workflow

## Executive Summary

Transform PA-QA from a 15% complete skeleton into a fully functional testing reference framework using parallel multi-agent workflows.

- **Component Testing**: React Testing Library v14+
- **API Mocking**: Mock Service Worker (MSW) v2.0+
- **E2E**: Playwright v1.40+
- **Accessibility**: axe-core, Pa11y

### WordPress Testing Stack  
- **Framework**: PHPUnit 9.x with WordPress polyfills
- **Setup**: @wordpress/env (modern approach)
- **Integration**: WP-CLI testing
- **PHP Version**: 8.1+
- **Code Quality**: PHP_CodeSniffer, PHPStan

## Execution Timeline

### Week 1-2: Phase 1 Execution
```typescript
// Launch all Phase 1 agents simultaneously
const phase1 = await Promise.all([
  ...reactAgents,
  ...wordpressAgents,
  ...fastapiAgents
]);
```

### Week 3-4: Phase 2 Execution
```typescript
// Launch all Phase 2 agents simultaneously
const phase2 = await Promise.all([
  ...utilityAgents,
  ...infrastructureAgents
]);
```

### Week 5-6: Phase 3 & 4 Execution
```typescript
// Launch remaining agents
const phase3and4 = await Promise.all([
  ...lintingAgents,
  ...documentationAgents
]);
```

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- ✅ 3 complete framework implementations (React, WordPress, FastAPI)
- ✅ 20+ reusable utility functions
- ✅ 5+ CI/CD platform templates
- ✅ 10+ Docker configurations
- ✅ 100% of tests passing out-of-box
- ✅ 70%+ code coverage in examples

### Qualitative
- ✅ Zero configuration required to run tests
- ✅ Clear, actionable documentation
- ✅ Industry best practices followed
- ✅ Patterns extracted and generalized
- ✅ Community-ready for open source

## Agent Coordination Strategy

### Parallel Execution Rules
1. All agents within a battalion execute simultaneously
2. No inter-agent dependencies within same phase
3. Results aggregated after battalion completion
4. Next phase begins only after previous phase validation

### Quality Gates
Each agent must:
- Generate working, tested code
- Include inline documentation
- Follow established patterns
- Pass linting checks
- Include usage examples

### Result Validation
After each battalion:
1. Automated test execution
2. Linting verification
3. Documentation review
4. Integration testing
5. Manual spot checks

## Risk Mitigation

### Agent Failures
- Retry failed agents with refined prompts
- Manual intervention for complex issues
- Fallback to sequential execution if needed

### Quality Assurance
- Each agent output reviewed before integration
- Automated testing of all generated code
- Manual testing of critical paths

### Scope Management
- Strict adherence to phase boundaries
- No scope creep within agent tasks
- Clear success criteria per agent

## Implementation Command

To execute this PRP:
```bash
# Execute Phase 1: Core Templates
/execute-prp phase1 --agents 15 --parallel

# Execute Phase 2: Utilities & Infrastructure  
/execute-prp phase2 --agents 12 --parallel

# Execute Phase 3-4: Quality & Documentation
/execute-prp phase3-4 --agents 8 --parallel

# Validate entire implementation
/validate-pa-qa --run-all-tests --check-coverage
```

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate Benefits
- PA-QA transforms from 15% to 100% complete
- All critical gaps addressed
- Immediately usable templates
- Production-ready test suites

### Long-term Value
- Accelerated test development for all projects
- Standardized testing across organization
- Reduced onboarding time for new developers
- Maintainable, scalable testing framework

## Appendix: Agent Task Distribution

### Total Agents: 35
- Phase 1: 15 agents (5 React + 4 WordPress + 6 FastAPI)
- Phase 2: 12 agents (4 Utilities + 8 Infrastructure)
- Phase 3: 3 agents (Linting)
- Phase 4: 5 agents (Documentation)

### Estimated Execution Time
- With parallel execution: 8-10 hours total
