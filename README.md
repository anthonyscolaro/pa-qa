# PA-QA: Standardized Testing Framework for Project Assistant

A production-ready E2E testing framework template for web applications. Use this repository as a reference and starting point for implementing comprehensive testing in all Project Assistant client projects.

## üéØ Purpose

This repository serves as the **gold standard** for testing practices at Project Assistant. It provides:
- Pre-configured testing tools and patterns
- Proven test architecture from real projects
- Documentation and examples for rapid implementation
- Consistent quality assurance across all client deliverables

### Using PA-QA with Context Engineering

When working on context engineering projects, add PA-QA as a reference to automatically implement testing standards:

**In your `CLAUDE.md` file:**
```markdown
## Testing Standards
Follow PA-QA framework from https://github.com/anthonyscolaro/pa-qa for all testing.
- Use TypeScript for all tests
- Implement Page Object Model
- Create test data factories
- Set up Playwright with Allure reporting
```

**In your `initial.md` file:**
```markdown
## Testing Requirements
Implement comprehensive E2E testing following PA-QA standards:
- Reference: https://github.com/anthonyscolaro/pa-qa
- See /docs/AI_PROMPTS.md for implementation patterns
- All tests must be TypeScript with Page Object Model
```

This makes PA-QA a reusable "context module" that ensures consistent testing across all projects. When you generate PRPs or execute features, the AI will automatically follow PA-QA standards.

## üöÄ How to Use This Repository

### Quick Setup for New Projects

1. **Run the Automated Setup Script**
   ```bash
   # Clone PA-QA
   git clone git@github.com:anthonyscolaro/pa-qa.git ~/reference/pa-qa
   
   # In your project directory, run the initialization
   ~/reference/pa-qa/scripts/init-pa-qa.sh
   ```
   
   This script will:
   - ‚úÖ Install Playwright and dependencies
   - ‚úÖ Create test directory structure
   - ‚úÖ Generate configuration files
   - ‚úÖ Set up GitHub Actions workflow
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Alert you if Vercel protection bypass is needed**

2. **For Vercel Deployments** (Important!)
   
   If your app deploys to Vercel, you'll see a prompt to enable Protection Bypass:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è VERCEL DEPLOYMENT PROTECTION SETUP REQUIRED
   
   1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Security
   2. Enable "Protection Bypass for Automation"
   3. Add the secret to GitHub:
      gh secret set VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET --body "your-secret"
   ```
   
   **This is critical** - Without this, E2E tests cannot access your protected deployments!
   
   See [docs/testing/deployment-testing.md](docs/testing/deployment-testing.md) for complete guide.

## ü§ñ AI Assistant Prompts

Use these prompts with Claude, ChatGPT, or other AI coding assistants to implement PA-QA standards in your project:

### Initial Setup Prompt
```
I want to set up E2E testing following the PA-QA framework standards from https://github.com/anthonyscolaro/pa-qa

Please help me:
1. Set up Playwright with TypeScript
2. Create a proper test structure with Page Object Model
3. Add test data factories using Faker.js
4. Configure Allure reporting
5. Create my first smoke test

My application is [describe your app - e.g., "a React e-commerce site"]
The main user flows are [list critical paths - e.g., "login, product search, checkout"]
```

### Page Object Creation Prompt
```
Following PA-QA standards, create a Page Object Model for my [login/registration/etc] page.

The page has these elements:
- [list form fields, buttons, etc.]

Use TypeScript with proper typing and follow this pattern:
- Extend from BasePage class
- Use data-testid selectors where possible
- Include methods for common interactions
- Add proper error handling
```

### Test Suite Generation Prompt
```
Using PA-QA framework patterns, create a comprehensive test suite for [feature name].

Requirements:
- Write in TypeScript (.spec.ts files)
- Use Page Object Model
- Include these test cases: [list scenarios]
- Add proper test data using factories
- Follow Playwright best practices
- Include retry logic for flaky operations
```

### Docker Setup Prompt
```
Help me containerize my Playwright tests following PA-QA standards.

Create:
1. docker-compose.yml with Playwright and Mailpit services
2. Dockerfile for test execution
3. Scripts for running tests in Docker
4. Allure reporting service configuration

My application runs on port [your port] and needs [any special services].
```

## üìä Success Metrics

Use these targets for your projects:

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Test Execution Time | < 10 min | Fast feedback loop |
| Test Reliability | > 95% | Trust in results |
| Code Coverage | > 80% | Confidence in changes |
| Cross-Browser Pass | 100% | Universal compatibility |
| Mobile Coverage | > 90% | Mobile-first world |

## üõ†Ô∏è Language & Patterns

### Language: TypeScript
All tests should be written in **TypeScript** for:
- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time
- **IntelliSense**: Better IDE support and autocomplete
- **Refactoring**: Safer code changes
- **Documentation**: Types serve as inline documentation
- **Industry Standard**: Most modern test frameworks use TypeScript

### Page Object Model (TypeScript)
```typescript
// tests/helpers/page-objects/login.page.ts
import { Page } from '@playwright/test';

export class LoginPage extends BasePage {
  constructor(private page: Page) {
    super(page);
  }

  async login(email: string, password: string): Promise<void> {
    await this.fill('[data-testid="email"]', email);
    await this.fill('[data-testid="password"]', password);
    await this.click('[data-testid="submit"]');
  }
}
```

### Test Data Factories (TypeScript)
```typescript
// tests/helpers/factories/user.factory.ts
import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker';

interface TestUser {
  email: string;
  password: string;
  name: string;
}

export const createTestUser = (): TestUser => ({
  email: faker.internet.email(),
  password: 'SecurePass123!',
  name: faker.person.fullName()
});
```

### Docker Testing
```yaml
# Standard docker-compose pattern
services:
  playwright:
    image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.40.0
    volumes:
      - ./tests:/tests
  mailpit:
    image: axllent/mailpit:latest
    ports:
      - "8025:8025"
```

3. **Execute Features**: Tests will be created following PA-QA patterns automatically

### Example Context Engineering Setup

```markdown
# In your project's CLAUDE.md or initial.md

## Project Standards
- Testing: PA-QA Framework (https://github.com/anthonyscolaro/pa-qa)
- All E2E tests must follow PA-QA patterns
- Refer to PA-QA's /docs/AI_PROMPTS.md for implementation

## When implementing any feature:
1. Create unit tests if backend logic
2. Create E2E tests following PA-QA standards
3. Use TypeScript and Page Object Model
4. Include test data factories
```

### Benefits of PA-QA as Context Module

- **Consistency**: Every project uses the same testing patterns
- **Speed**: No need to explain testing requirements each time
- **Quality**: Battle-tested patterns that work
- **Maintenance**: Update PA-QA once, all projects benefit
- **Knowledge Transfer**: New developers learn one standard

---

**Remember**: Good testing isn't about perfection, it's about confidence. Start with smoke tests, add critical paths, then expand coverage over time.
