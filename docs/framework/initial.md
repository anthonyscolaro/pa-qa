## FEATURE: Standardized E2E Testing Framework for Project Assistant

A comprehensive, production-ready testing framework template for web applications that Project Assistant develops, based on modern testing best practices with Playwright, Allure reporting, and Docker containerization.

## PURPOSE

Create a standardized testing methodology that:
- Provides consistent quality assurance across all client projects
- Enables rapid test development and execution
- Offers comprehensive reporting and debugging capabilities
- Scales from simple smoke tests to complex E2E scenarios
- Integrates seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines
- Supports multi-browser and mobile testing

## CORE TESTING STACK

1. **Playwright** - Primary E2E testing framework
   - Cross-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
   - Mobile viewport testing
   - API testing capabilities
   - Network interception and mocking
   - Visual regression testing

2. **Allure** - Advanced test reporting
   - Beautiful HTML reports with screenshots
   - Test history and trends
   - Categories for test failures
   - Real-time reporting dashboard
   - Integration with CI/CD

3. **Docker** - Containerized test execution
   - Consistent test environment
   - Parallel test execution
   - Easy CI/CD integration
   - Service dependencies (databases, mail servers)

4. **Supporting Tools**
   - Mailpit/MailHog for email testing
   - Faker.js for test data generation
   - dotenv for environment configuration
   - Page Object Model for maintainability
