2. **Generate unit tests** with specialized agents
3. **Create integration tests** in parallel
4. **Build E2E scenarios** simultaneously
5. **Set up CI/CD pipelines** automatically

### How much faster are multi-agent workflows?

**Up to 70% faster** than manual test development:

```
Manual Approach:    4-6 hours for complete test suite
Multi-Agent:        1-2 hours for same coverage
Improvement:        70% time reduction
```

### How do I use multi-agent workflows?

```bash
# Generate complete test suite
pa-qa generate-test-suite react --with-e2e --with-a11y

# Enhance existing tests
pa-qa enhance-coverage fastapi --focus=integration

# Migrate between frameworks
pa-qa migrate-tests jest vitest
```

See our [Multi-Agent Workflow Guide](/docs/best-practices/multi-agent-workflow.md) for details.
