# PA-QA Testing Showcase - Problem Requirements Plan (PRP)

## Executive Summary

Following comprehensive Playwright testing of the PA-QA Testing Showcase application, this document outlines the remaining issues to address and proposed solutions for production readiness.

**Current Status**: Application is functional at http://localhost:3006 with all pages accessible and core features working.

## Issues Identified & Requirements

### 1. Console Errors (High Priority) 游댮

#### Problem
- 48 console errors detected across all pages
- Types: 404 errors, MIME type mismatches, React hydration errors

#### Requirements
- [ ] Fix resource loading 404 errors
- [ ] Resolve CSS MIME type issues 
- [ ] Address React Error #418 (hydration mismatches)
- [ ] Ensure error-free console on all pages

#### Technical Details
```
Errors found:
- Failed to load resource: 404 (Not Found)
- Refused to execute script from '*.css' (MIME type issue)
- React error #418: Hydration mismatch warnings
```

#### Solution Approach
1. Audit all static resource imports
2. Fix Next.js configuration for proper CSS handling
3. Review server/client component boundaries
4. Implement proper error boundaries

- No visual separation between template categories
- Users reported expecting tab navigation

#### Requirements
- [ ] Implement tabbed interface for template categories
- [ ] Add category filtering/switching
- [ ] Maintain current card design within tabs
- [ ] Ensure smooth tab transitions

#### Mockup Structure
```

- Some features are placeholders showing "Coming Soon"

#### Requirements
- [ ] Add real-time data updates to API Dashboard
- [ ] Implement working test execution in React Playground
- [ ] Add actual E2E test running capabilities
- [ ] Connect to backend services or use realistic mock data

---

### 4. Performance Optimization (Low Priority) 游릭

#### Problem
- Initial page load can be slow
- Large bundle size (1.56 MB First Load JS)

#### Requirements
- [ ] Implement code splitting for showcase pages
- [ ] Optimize image loading with Next.js Image component
- [ ] Add lazy loading for below-fold content
- [ ] Reduce initial bundle size below 1 MB

---

### 5. Template Demo Pages Completion (Low Priority) 游릭

#### Problem
- Only 4 demo templates configured out of 11 total
- Some demos show "Interactive Demo Coming Soon"

#### Requirements
- [ ] Complete demo configurations for all 11 templates
- [ ] Add live preview functionality where possible
- [ ] Include framework-specific examples
- [ ] Add download functionality for template ZIP files

#### Missing Demo Configurations

- [ ] User acceptance testing

---

## Success Criteria

1. **Zero Console Errors**: Clean console on all pages
2. **Performance**: Lighthouse score > 90
3. **Coverage**: Test coverage > 80%
4. **Load Time**: Initial page load < 2 seconds
5. **Bundle Size**: First Load JS < 1 MB
6. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

---

## Resources Required

### Development
- 1 Frontend Developer (2-3 weeks)
- 1 Backend Developer (1 week for API integration)
- 1 QA Engineer (1 week)

### Tools & Services
- Error monitoring (Sentry)
- Performance monitoring (DataDog/New Relic)
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Hosting (Vercel/Netlify)

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Hydration errors persist | High | Medium | Thorough component audit |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Low | Implement monitoring |
| Breaking changes | High | Low | Comprehensive test suite |
| Browser compatibility | Medium | Medium | Cross-browser testing |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Fix critical console errors
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Set up error monitoring

2. **Short Term** (1-2 weeks)
   - Implement tabbed templates
   - Complete demo pages
   - Add integration tests

3. **Long Term** (3-4 weeks)
   - Performance optimization
